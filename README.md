# SUIT

[![TravisCI][build-badge]][build]

The Search User Interface Toolkit, or SUIT, is a library for creating search applications on top of the index in an Attivio, Elasticsearch or Solr installation.

SUIT is built using components based on the React library, along with additional functionality necessary to communicate with the back-end servers. It is used as the basis for the Search UI application, available in its own repository. You can create your own applications by using Search UI as a starting point or by simply including SUIT as a dependency in your own project.

## React
SUIT is built using React and is intended to be used by other applications also using React. Details about React can be found on the [projectâ€™s website](https://reactjs.org).

### Versions
To ensure your application functions as expected, the version of react in your application should match the version of react used in the version of SUIT you are using. (See the `package.json` file in the version of SUIT you are using to find the specific React version to use.)

- version 1.0.0 and later of SUIT use version 16 of React
- earlier versions of SUIT use version 15 of React

### Upgrading

If you are upgading a project from version 0.1 to version 1.0 of SUIT, you might wish to look at information from the [React 16 Release Notes](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases?after=16.1.0-rc) and the [React 16 Guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html) for assistance.
