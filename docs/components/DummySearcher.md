The `<DummySearcher>` component is a mock version of the searcher component for use in
this styleguide only.

#### Examples:

__1.__ This component doesn’t render anything in the browser. It merely serves as a context
for Searcher-dependent components with mucg of the back-end related functionality stubbed out.
You can see it used, for example, in the examples for components such as `<SearchResultsCount>`
or `<SearchBar>`.

```jsx
  <DummySearcher />
```
